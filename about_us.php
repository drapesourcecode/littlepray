                  <p>CARE is a not-for-profit organization working in India for over 65 years, focusing on alleviating poverty and social injustice. We do this through well planned and comprehensive projects in health, education, livelihoods and disaster preparedness and response. Our overall goal is the empowerment of women and girls from poor and marginalised communities leading to improvement in their lives and livelihoods.</p>
    
                  <p>During FY 2017-18, CARE India directly reached out to&nbsp;24.1 million people directly through 38 projects across 14 states, covering more than 90 districts. We are part of the CARE International Confederation, working in over 90 countries for a world where all people live with dignity and security.</p>

                             <h4>Why Women and Girls?</h4>
           <p>CARE focuses on the empowerment of women and girls because they are disproportionately affected by poverty and discrimination; and suffer abuse and violations in the realisation of their rights, entitlements and access and control over resources. Also, experience shows that, when equipped with the proper resources, women have the power to help whole families and entire communities overcome poverty, marginalisation and social injustice.</p>
